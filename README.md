# TODOMVC example in TypeScript

There is an example of TODOMVC written in TypeScript using a fake backend.

It is the first example I wrote using TypeScript and it is a good experience. A bit verbose sometimes but the typing helped me with some issues ;)

## Trying it

Global dependencies:

```plain
$ npm install -g gulp tsd
```

Install dependencies:

```plain
$ npm install
$ tsd reinstall -so
```

Run it:

```
$ gulp
```

Now open your browser: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

`NOTE: Keep in mind that this workflow is something I did quick for the example. It is not meant to be used on a real project.`
